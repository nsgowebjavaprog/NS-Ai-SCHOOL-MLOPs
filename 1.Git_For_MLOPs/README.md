### **1. Git is a SCM**

* **Git** is a **Source Code Management (SCM)** or **Version Control System (VCS)**.
* SCM helps track changes in source code during software development.
* Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project **without overwriting each other's changes**.

---

### **2. Need & Why Learn Git**

* Git is widely used in **software development, data science, MLOps, and AI projects**.
* Benefits:

  1. Tracks changes in code over time.
  2. Easy collaboration with team members.
  3. Provides history to revert to previous versions.
  4. Supports branching for feature development.
* Learning Git is essential because it’s **industry-standard** for code management.

---

### **3. How Git Helps in Bug Fixing & Version Control**

* **Bug fixing:**

  * Git allows developers to **create branches** for bug fixes.
  * Changes can be tested independently without affecting main code.
  * Easy to **rollback** if a fix breaks the code.
* **Version control:**

  * Git tracks every change made to files with timestamps and author info.
  * You can **compare versions, merge changes, or revert** to any previous state.

---

### **4. How Git Helps Collaboration**

* Multiple developers can work simultaneously using **branches**.
* **Merge requests / Pull requests** allow code review before integration.
* Conflicts are handled systematically.
* Teams can track **who changed what and when**, ensuring accountability.

---

### **5. What is Non-linear Development in Git**

* Non-linear development is using **branches and merges** to allow multiple parallel development streams.
* Example:

  * Feature A in branch `feature-a`
  * Feature B in branch `feature-b`
  * Both features developed independently, then merged to `main/master`.
* Git’s **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** architecture supports this efficiently.

## **1. How Branching and Merging Happens in Git**

### **Branching**

* A **branch** is a pointer to a specific commit in the repository.
* Default branch is usually `main` or `master`.
* When you create a new branch, Git creates a **parallel line of development**.
* Each branch can have its own **commits** without affecting other branches.

**Example Workflow:**

1. Start with `main` branch.
2. Create branch `feature-A` → develop new feature there.
3. Commits on `feature-A` do not affect `main`.

### **Merging**

* **Merge** combines the changes from one branch into another.
* Example: Merge `feature-A` into `main` after testing.
* Git tries **automatic merge**; if conflicts exist, you resolve them manually.

**Non-linear development:**
Multiple features (branches) are developed simultaneously and merged back into `main` as needed.

## **2. Commands for Branching and Merging**

| Action               | Command                         | Example                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Create branch        | `git branch <branch_name>`      | `git branch feature-A`                      |
| Check branches       | `git branch`                    | `git branch`                                |
| Switch branch        | `git checkout <branch_name>`    | `git checkout feature-A`                    |
| Create + switch      | `git checkout -b <branch_name>` | `git checkout -b feature-B`                 |
| Merge branch         | `git merge <branch_name>`       | `git merge feature-A` (into current branch) |
| Delete branch        | `git branch -d <branch_name>`   | `git branch -d feature-A`                   |
| View merge conflicts | `git status`                    | `git status`                                |

# What is centralized and distributed version control system in git how it's helps in Git and MLOps and data science

---

## **1. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**

### **Definition**

* In CVCS, there is a **single central repository** that contains the latest version of the code.
* Developers **check out** files, make changes, and **commit back** to the central server.

### **How it works**

```
Developer 1 ----\
Developer 2 ----- Central Server (Repository)
Developer 3 ----/
```

### **Examples**

* Subversion (SVN), CVS, Perforce

### **Pros**

* Simple to understand.
* Single source of truth.
* Easy to manage permissions and access control.

### **Cons**

* Requires network access for most operations.
* If the central server goes down → no one can commit.
* Harder to work offline.

---

## **2. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**

### **Definition**

* In DVCS, **every developer has a full copy of the repository**, including its entire history.
* Git is a **DVCS**.

### **How it works**

```
Developer 1 <----> Developer 2 <----> Developer 3
        \             |            /
         \-----------> Central Repository (optional)
```

* Developers can **commit, branch, merge locally** without network.
* Changes are synced with remote repository only when `push` or `pull`.

### **Pros**

* Work offline → full commit history locally.
* Safer → multiple copies of repo.
* Supports **non-linear development** (branches, merges) very efficiently.
* Faster operations (commits, logs, diffs) since everything is local.

### **Cons**

* Slightly more complex for beginners.
* Requires understanding of syncing (`push`, `pull`, `fetch`).

---

## **3. How it Helps in Git**

* Git is **distributed**, so you can:

  * Work offline and commit changes locally.
  * Create and test multiple branches safely.
  * Merge changes from multiple developers efficiently.
* Every developer has a full repo → history is safe even if central server crashes.

---

## **4. Relevance to MLOps and Data Science**

| Area                      | How DVCS (Git) Helps                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MLOps**                 | - Track **model code, data preprocessing scripts, pipeline scripts**. <br> - Collaborate on **CI/CD pipelines**. <br> - Safe branching for experiments, model upgrades. |
| **Data Science**          | - Track **notebooks, datasets (small size), scripts**. <br> - Compare different **EDA experiments**. <br> - Collaborative workflow across team members.                 |
| **Experiment Management** | - Branches allow **trying new models or hyperparameters** without affecting main branch. <br> - Merge only **tested and validated experiments**.                        |
| **Disaster Recovery**     | - Multiple copies of repo → prevents data/code loss.                                                                                                                    |

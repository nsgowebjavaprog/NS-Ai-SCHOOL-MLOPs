# What is ML:
`Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.
It focuses on building algorithms and models that can recognize patterns, make predictions, or take decisions based on data.`

# What is MLOPs:  
`MLOps is a set of practices and tools used to deploy, monitor, and manage Machine Learning models in production efficiently and reliably.
It combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to automate the entire ML lifecycle â€” from data collection to model deployment and monitoring.`

# What is DevOps:
`DevOps is a combination of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) practices that aims to build, test, and release software faster, more reliably, and efficiently.`

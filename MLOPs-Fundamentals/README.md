# What is ML:
`Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.
It focuses on building algorithms and models that can recognize patterns, make predictions, or take decisions based on data.`

# What is MLOPs:  
`MLOps is a set of practices and tools used to deploy, monitor, and manage Machine Learning models in production efficiently and reliably.
It combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to automate the entire ML lifecycle ‚Äî from data collection to model deployment and monitoring.`

# What is DevOps:
`DevOps is a combination of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) practices that aims to build, test, and release software faster, more reliably, and efficiently.` 

-----------------------------------------------------
# What is SDLC:
`SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process that defines how software is developed, from idea to deployment and maintenance.`

# SDLC 6-Steps as Following:

`1.Planning of the project`

`2.Designing the project`

# Diff-Models:

1.`Water-Fall Model.`

2.`Agile Model.`

-----------------------------------------------------
# 1. Water-Fall model: 
`The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to project development.
Each phase must be completed fully before moving to the next ‚Äî there‚Äôs little flexibility for changes once a phase is done.` [link](https://www.scaler.com/topics/images/several-consecutive-phases-of-the-classical-waterfall-model.webp)


# Agile Model:
`The Agile model is an iterative and flexible approach.
Instead of finishing everything at once, work happens in small cycles (called sprints) ‚Äî with continuous feedback, testing, and improvements.`  [link](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230209142829/Capture-660.PNG)



# See Here Diff B/W 2.

3. `EDA`
4. `FE`
5. `Model Building and evaluation`

-----------------------------------------------------
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Building (Model Development Phase):

`üéØ Goal:

To design, build, and train a reliable ML model using high-quality data and reproducible workflows.

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Explanation:

Involves data engineering + model engineering.

Data scientists collect, clean, and preprocess data using ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load).

Feature engineering is automated using tools like Feature Store (Feast, Tecton).

Model development uses versioned experiments with tools like MLflow, Weights & Biases, or DVC to track:

Code versions

Model hyperparameters

Metrics

Data versions

üß© Key Tools:

Data: Airflow, Spark, Delta Lake

Model: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn

Versioning: Git, DVC, MLflow

‚úÖ Outcome:
A trained, versioned, and validated model ready for testing.`

------------------------------------------------

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing (Model Validation & QA Phase):

`üéØ Goal:

To ensure the model‚Äôs quality, accuracy, fairness, and robustness before deploying it to production.

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Explanation:

Go beyond normal testing ‚Äî test for:

Data validation: Check data schema, missing values, and distribution drift.

Model validation: Evaluate precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.

Bias & fairness tests: Detect and mitigate bias using tools like IBM AI Fairness 360.

Performance tests: Stress test model latency and throughput.

Integration tests: Verify APIs, model-serving endpoints, and infrastructure.

üß© Key Tools:

Great Expectations (for data validation)

TensorFlow Model Analysis

pytest + CI pipelines for automation

‚úÖ Outcome:
A production-ready, performance-tested, bias-free model.`

------------------------------------------------

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Delivery (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery - CI/CD):

`What It Means:

In MLOps, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) automate the path from development to deployment.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Processes:

CI (Continuous Integration):

Automatically test and validate every code or model update.

Tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI.

CD (Continuous Delivery):

Package the validated model (using Docker or MLflow) and store it in a Model Registry.

Tools: MLflow Model Registry, S3, Azure ML Registry.

üí° Goal:

Enable automated and version-controlled delivery of ML models from training to staging.`

------------------------------------------------

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment (Productionizing Models)

`What It Means:

Deployment is where trained ML models are exposed as services or integrated into production systems.

‚öôÔ∏è Common Deployment Strategies:

Batch Deployment: Run model predictions on a schedule (e.g., daily fraud detection).

Real-Time Deployment: Serve predictions instantly via APIs (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, gRPC).

Streaming Deployment: Continuous model inference from data streams (e.g., Kafka, Spark Streaming).

üß∞ Tools:

Docker / Kubernetes: For containerization and scaling.

Seldon Core / BentoML / KFServing: For model serving.

AWS Sagemaker / Vertex AI / Azure ML: Cloud-native deployment.

üí° Goal:

To deploy models reliably, automatically, and at scale with minimal downtime.`

------------------------------------------------

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Maintenance (Model Lifecycle Management)

`What It Means:

Maintenance in MLOps is about keeping the model, data pipelines, and infrastructure healthy post-deployment.

üß† Core Activities:

Model Retraining: Automatically retrain models when performance drops or data drifts.

Version Control: Manage different model versions and rollbacks.

Pipeline Updates: Update feature pipelines or training pipelines as data evolves.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools:

Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, MLflow, and DVC for automated retraining.

Git for code versioning and Model Registry for model versions.

üí° Goal:

Ensure that the system adapts to new data and remains accurate without manual intervention.`

------------------------------------------------
# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring (Observability & Performance Tracking)

`What It Means:

After deployment, continuous monitoring is done to ensure the model is performing as expected and not degrading over time.

üß† Key Types of Monitoring:

Data Drift Monitoring: Detect when incoming data distributions change (e.g., new user behavior).

Model Drift Monitoring: Identify when model predictions degrade over time.

Performance Monitoring: Track latency, resource usage, and uptime.

Business Metrics Monitoring: Track KPIs like conversion rate, revenue impact, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools:

Evidently AI, Fiddler AI, WhyLabs, Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.

MLflow & Kibana for logs and metrics.

üí° Goal:

To maintain model accuracy, reliability, and trust through continuous visibility and alerts.`

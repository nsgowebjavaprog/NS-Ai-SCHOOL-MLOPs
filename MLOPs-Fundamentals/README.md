# NS-Ai-SCHOOL-MLOPs
NS Ai SCHOOL || MLOPs

In this Session we will learn aabout `MLOPs` Fundamentals and Overview of `MLOPs`

For more [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpU8F0M5axo&list=PLmQAMKHKeLZ9iaLWBULDE_hiPtOiHiDz0&index=2).

pre-requirements are as following:

1.`Basic of ML & DL`

2.`Basic of the Python`

3.`Devops`

4.`Basic front-end Web-Development`

# What is ML:
`Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.
It focuses on building algorithms and models that can recognize patterns, make predictions, or take decisions based on data.`

# What is MLOPs:  
`MLOps is a set of practices and tools used to deploy, monitor, and manage Machine Learning models in production efficiently and reliably.
It combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to automate the entire ML lifecycle — from data collection to model deployment and monitoring.`

# What is DevOps:
`DevOps is a combination of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) practices that aims to build, test, and release software faster, more reliably, and efficiently.` 

-----------------------------------------------------
# What is SDLC:
`SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process that defines how software is developed, from idea to deployment and maintenance.`

| Phase                        | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Requirement Analysis** | Understand what the user or business needs.                                 |
| 2️⃣ **Design**               | Plan how the software will look and function (architecture, UI, data flow). |
| 3️⃣ **Development**          | Write and implement the actual code.                                        |
| 4️⃣ **Testing**              | Verify that the software works correctly and fix bugs.                      |
| 5️⃣ **Deployment**           | Release the application to users or production.                             |
| 6️⃣ **Maintenance**          | Continuously improve, fix, and update the system after release.             |

# SDLC 6-Steps as Following:

`1.Planning of the project`

`2.Designing the project`

`3.Building of the project`

`4.Testing of the project`

`5.Deploying the project`

`6.Maintain and manage the project`

# Diff-Models:

1.`Water-Fall Model.`

2.`Agile Model.`

-----------------------------------------------------
# 1. Water-Fall model: 
`The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to project development.
Each phase must be completed fully before moving to the next — there’s little flexibility for changes once a phase is done.` [link](https://www.scaler.com/topics/images/several-consecutive-phases-of-the-classical-waterfall-model.webp)


# Agile Model:
`The Agile model is an iterative and flexible approach.
Instead of finishing everything at once, work happens in small cycles (called sprints) — with continuous feedback, testing, and improvements.`  [link](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230209142829/Capture-660.PNG)

| Feature         | **Waterfall Model** | **Agile Model**              |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Workflow        | Linear              | Iterative                    |
| Flexibility     | Rigid               | Flexible                     |
| Feedback        | After completion    | Continuous                   |
| Speed           | Slow                | Fast (sprints)               |
| Change Handling | Difficult           | Easy                         |
| Best for        | Static ML models    | Dynamic, evolving ML systems |

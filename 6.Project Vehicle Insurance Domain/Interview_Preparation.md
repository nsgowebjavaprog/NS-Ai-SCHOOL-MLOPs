# 2.MongoDB Setup & Notebook Experiment:


---

## **1. Why use MongoDB? Why not SQL? Advantages & Disadvantages**

### **Why MongoDB**

* Schema-less, flexible JSON/BSON storage → good for storing dynamic ML data (e.g., experiments, model metadata, logs).
* Easy horizontal scaling → suitable for large datasets.
* Built-in replication → high availability.
* Fast for read-heavy workloads.

### **Can we use SQL?**

* Yes, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) can be used for structured data, relational datasets, or experiment tracking.
* But for unstructured logs, JSON configs, or versioned models, MongoDB is easier.

### **Advantages & Disadvantages**

| Feature      | SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)      | MongoDB                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schema       | Fixed, strict               | Flexible, dynamic                                           |
| Scaling      | Vertical scaling            | Horizontal scaling                                          |
| Transactions | ACID supported              | Limited, newer versions support multi-doc ACID              |
| Query        | SQL language, JOINs         | JSON-based query, aggregation pipeline                      |
| Use case     | Structured, relational data | Unstructured, semi-structured, ML logs, experiment metadata |
| Disadvantage | Hard to change schema       | Less strict consistency, joins complex                      |

✅ **MLOps example:**

* Store ML experiment metadata like `{"model":"XGB","accuracy":0.92,"dataset_version":"v3"}` → MongoDB is simpler than SQL tables for this.

---

## **2. What is a Cluster in MongoDB & ML Ops usage**

* **Cluster:** A set of MongoDB servers working together → can be **replica set** (high availability) or **sharded cluster** (scalable).
* **Replica set:** Primary + secondary nodes for failover.
* **Sharded cluster:** Data split across nodes → horizontal scaling.

**MLOps relevance:**

* Store large ML datasets, logs, and model versions across clusters.
* Ensures high availability for online inference services.

---

## **3. How to set up MongoDB for MLOps**

   * Flexible JSON, scalable, stores experiment logs & model metadata easily.

2. **How to track experiments?**

   * Store hyperparameters, metrics, dataset version in a MongoDB collection → easy querying & dashboarding.

3. **What is a collection vs document?**

   * Collection ≈ table, Document ≈ row (JSON).
   * Example: `experiments` collection with JSON docs for each training run.

4. **How to query best-performing model?**

```python
best_model = experiments.find().sort("accuracy",-1).limit(1)
```

5. **Replica set vs Sharding?**

   * Replica → HA, Shard → Scale horizontally.
   * Example: Large dataset sharded across nodes for distributed training.

6. **How to connect ML pipeline to MongoDB?**

   * Use `pymongo` in training scripts, save logs, metrics, and model versions.

7. **Can MongoDB store models?**

   * Not ideal for large binary files. Use GridFS or store in S3/MinIO, metadata in MongoDB.

8. **Logger integration example:**

   * Save logs as documents:

```python
logs.insert_one({"step":10, "loss":0.123, "timestamp":"2025-10-24T19:00:00"})
```

9. **How to monitor performance?**

   * Aggregate metrics over experiments:

```python
pipeline = [
  {"$group":{"_id":"$model","avg_acc":{"$avg":"$accuracy"}}}
]
db.experiments.aggregate(pipeline)
```

10. **Data versioning in MongoDB**

    * Store dataset hash/version in document → easy reproducibility.

---

## **5. What is a Logger File in MLOps**

* Logger files store **training, evaluation, and pipeline logs**.
* Use `logging` module in Python:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='mlops.log', level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("Training started...")
```

* In MLOps, logs → MongoDB (or ELK) for centralized monitoring.

---

## **6. How connection works between MLOps project & MongoDB**

**Pipeline example:**

1. **Training Script** → connects via `pymongo` → inserts run info.
2. **Pipeline Orchestration (Airflow/Kubeflow)** → triggers scripts → collects metrics → stores in MongoDB.
3. **Monitoring & Dashboard (Grafana/Streamlit)** → queries MongoDB → visualizes metrics.
4. **Model Registry** → MongoDB stores metadata, S3 stores binary model.

**Diagram (conceptual)**:

```
[Training Script] --> [MongoDB] <-- [Monitoring/Dashboard]
      |
      --> [Model Artifacts in S3/MinIO]
```

# 3. In MLOPs need a experiment for using following:
-----

## **1. Importing Data**

**What:**

* Bringing your dataset into your Python/ML environment from CSV, database, API, or cloud storage.

**Why:**

* ML models cannot work on raw files — data must be loaded in memory as DataFrame (Pandas) or array (NumPy).
* Ensures reproducibility if you store the source path or API endpoint.

**Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("vehicle_insurance.csv")
```

* In MLOps: Data import step is automated in pipelines (Airflow/Kubeflow) to fetch latest data for retraining.

---

## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**What:**

* Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to understand structure, patterns, missing values, and distributions.

**Why:**

* Helps identify problems, detect outliers, and select features.
* Prevents model failure due to incorrect assumptions.

**Example:**

```python
df.describe()
df['age'].hist()
df.isnull().sum()
```

* In MLOps: EDA can be automated to generate a report for every new dataset version.

---

## **3. Data Ingestion**

**What:**

* Process of collecting raw data from sources (databases, APIs, logs, cloud storage) and moving it to storage for processing.

**Why:**

* Ensures data pipeline is reproducible and scalable.
* Foundation for automated pipelines in MLOps.

**Example:**

* Pulling user logs from MongoDB, storing in S3/MinIO, and triggering preprocessing script.

---

## **4. Data Preprocessing**

**What:**

* Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for ML model training. Steps include:

  * Handling missing values
  * Encoding categorical variables
  * Scaling numerical features
  * Feature engineering

**Why:**

* Raw data is noisy; ML algorithms need numerical, clean, and scaled features for accurate predictions.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df['gender'] = le.fit_transform(df['gender'])
```

* In MLOps: Preprocessing steps are stored as reusable pipeline objects (Pipeline in sklearn, or Prefect/MLflow pipeline).

---

## **5. Model Training (Random Forest Classifier)**

**What:**

* Teaching a ML algorithm to learn patterns from training data. Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees for classification tasks.

**Why:**

* Predict outcomes (e.g., vehicle insurance claim = yes/no).
* Random Forest handles nonlinear data, reduces overfitting, and works well with mixed feature types.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)
```

* In MLOps: Model training is automated with versioned data, hyperparameters tracked in MLflow, model saved in S3/MinIO.

---

## **6. Model Evaluation**

**What:**

* Measuring how well the trained model performs on unseen/test data. Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

**Why:**

* Ensures model generalizes and is reliable in production.
* Detects underfitting/overfitting.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

* In MLOps: Evaluation results logged to MongoDB/MLflow → dashboards monitor performance for retraining triggers.

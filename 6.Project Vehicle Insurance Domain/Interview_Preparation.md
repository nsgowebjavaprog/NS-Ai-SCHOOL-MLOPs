`Interview question with Answer for the Project level`

# Interview Ready Project Explanation:

# 1. Very Basic Level:

---

## **1. Git & Version Control**

**Q:** What is Git and why use it?
**Answer:**

> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks code changes and allows collaboration. Advantages: version history, branching, merging, easy rollback, and conflict resolution.

**Q:** What is GitHub?
**Answer:**

> GitHub is a cloud platform to host Git repositories, enabling collaboration, code review, and project management.

**Q:** Difference between Git and GitHub?
**Answer:**

> Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.

**Q:** What is branching and merging?
**Answer:**

> Branching allows working on features independently; merging integrates changes back to the main branch.

**Q:** What is a staging area and commit in Git?
**Answer:**

> Staging area holds changes before committing; commit saves changes to the local repository with a message.

## **2. Data Science Concepts**

**Q:** Explain overfitting and underfitting.
**Answer:**

> Overfitting: model learns noise → poor generalization.
> Underfitting: model too simple → cannot capture patterns.
> Solutions: regularization, cross-validation, more data, feature engineering.

**Q:** How do you handle missing data?
**Answer:**

> Methods: remove rows/columns, mean/median/mode imputation, predictive imputation, or encoding missing as a category.

**Q:** Difference between classification and regression?
**Answer:**

> Classification → discrete labels (spam/not spam)
> Regression → continuous values (house price prediction)

**Q:** Explain precision, recall, F1-score.
**Answer:**

> Precision = TP / (TP + FP), Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
> F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

**Q:** What is cross-validation?
**Answer:**

> Technique to evaluate model generalization by splitting data into training/validation folds.

**Q:** What is a Dockerfile?
**Answer:**

**Q:** What is Docker Image vs Container?
**Answer:**

> Image → blueprint of environment & code
> Container → running instance of the image

**Q:** Explain model versioning.
**Answer:**

> Keep track of changes to models with unique IDs, metadata, and deployment info. MLflow or DVC can help.

**Answer:**

> Use distributed computing (Spark), containerized pipelines (Docker + Kubernetes), and workflow orchestration (Airflow).

**Q:** How do you deploy a CI/CD pipeline for ML?
**Answer:**

> Automate testing, building Docker images, model validation, and deployment via GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

**Q:** How to handle biased ML models?
**Answer:**

> Detect bias using fairness metrics, re-balance training data, use fairness-aware algorithms, and monitor outputs.

**Q:** How to track experiments efficiently?
**Answer:**

> Use MLflow/W&B: log datasets, parameters, metrics, and model versions for reproducibility.
